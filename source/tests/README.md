## Instructions for Running Unit Tests
---

The following steps can be done to run the unit tests contained in the `tests` directory:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project `/deployment` directory.
2. Run this command in the terminal:
```shell
sh run-unit-tests.sh
```
3. A new virtual environment should now be created with the script with test environment variables. The tests will also execute.
4. A coverage report will be generated for SonarQube and can be viewed in the `tests/coverage-reports` directory.
